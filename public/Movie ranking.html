<h3>"Lost Highway"<br />
David Lynch</h3>
<p>A dark, intriguing, atmospheric and labyrinthic plot that takes you to Lynch's so unique cinematographic spaces and emotions</p>
<h3>"Barry Lindon" <br />
Stanley Kubrick</h3>
<p>One of Kubrick's greatest masterpiece, an absolute delight to the eyes, this movie where each scene resembles an 18TH century painting, portrays the rise and fall of a parvenu in his adventures across Europe.</p>
